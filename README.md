# AnalystGPT

## AI that visualize your data by your command
As a data scientist, I know how time-consuming and frustrating it can be to create data visualizations. That's why this weekend, I decided to build AnalystGPT with the goal of automating this process. AnalystGPT allows anyone to easily analyze and visualize their data without having to spend hours on complex software or learning data analysis skills. With AnalystGPT, all you need to do is upload your spreadsheet data and chat with GPT-3 (OpenAI Codex) to get your desired visualization generated in no time. It's so easy and user-friendly, even people with no data analysis skills can use it!
